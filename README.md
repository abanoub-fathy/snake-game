## Improvements 

This is a basic Snake game implementation, and there's room for exciting additions:

- Sound Effects: Enhance the gameplay experience by incorporating sound effects for actions like eating food, hitting snake body, and game over.
- Levels: Introduce difficulty levels by changing the size of the play area, or introducing obstacles. This can add a layer of challenge and keep players engaged.
- Pausing the Game: Implement a pause functionality using keyboard input or a dedicated button to allow players to temporarily stop the game and resume later. This can be useful for taking breaks or strategizing their next move.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. Feel free to explore other creative enhancements to make this Snake game even more enjoyable!
